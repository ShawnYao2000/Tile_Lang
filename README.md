# TileLang

TileLang is a powerful language designed for manipulating tiles (matrices) using a variety of operations, including matrix and, matrix or, matrix xor, rotation, flipping, and more. It provides a convenient and expressive way to work with tiles in programming.

## How to Use

To use TileLang, follow the steps below:

1. **Granting execute permission**: Since it is likely that you are downloading the file from GitHub, you may need to grant execute permission for the UNIX executable files by using the following commands:
`chmod +x tv`
`chmod +x Tsl`

2. **Sample**: A Sample code will be given, and you will know about the basic logic and command of the language.

3. **Run the TileLang program**: After successful compilation, you can run the TileLang program with your own code by executing the following command:
`./Tsl <your_code.tsl>`
Replace `<your_code.tsl>` with the name of your TileLang code file.

4. **A tileviewer(tv) has been provided as a UNIX executable file, paste your generated matrix to a file in the same folder as tv and view your result using the following command:
`./tv <your_result.tl>`

## Requirements

To use TileLang, ensure that you have the following dependencies installed on your system:

- Haskell
- Other required dependencies (specified in the project documentation)

Make sure to have a compatible Haskell compiler and the necessary libraries installed to compile and run TileLang programs.
